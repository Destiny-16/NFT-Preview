## My process
1.) Add all HTML elements
2.) Group elements together in divs
3.) Add styling with css
4.) Add hover states

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During this project, I was able to practice using Flexbox for CSS styling, and I learned how to add hover states.

### Continued development

I think I could use some more practice creating overlays with images because, in the project, the overlay in the image work independently of each other and are not shown at the same time.

### Useful resources

- [Image Overay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me create the overlay for the main image
